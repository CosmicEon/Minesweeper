    The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the
    player, are designated to contain mines. Typically, the size of the grid and the number of mines are set in advance by
    the user, either by entering the numbers or selecting from defined skill levels, depending on the implementation. The
    game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square. If a square containing
    a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating
    how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares
    will be recursively revealed. The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either
    safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.
